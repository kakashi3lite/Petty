- **Time Period**: Ongoing data collection since 2024
- **Geographic Coverage**: Initially US-focused, expanding globally
- **Pet Demographics**: Dogs aged 6 months to 15 years, various breeds and sizes

### Data Preprocessing
- GPS coordinate precision limited to 6 decimal places for privacy
- Heart rate normalization based on breed and age factors
- Activity level quantization to three discrete levels (0-2)
- Temporal windowing for statistical analysis (5-60 minute windows)

## Performance

### Benchmark Comparisons
- **Human Expert Agreement**: 84% average across all behaviors
- **Inter-rater Reliability**: κ = 0.78 (substantial agreement)
- **Temporal Consistency**: 91% day-to-day stability for recurring behaviors

### Performance Variations
- **By Breed**: 15% variance between breeds (working dogs vs. toy breeds)
- **By Age**: 12% lower accuracy for senior pets (>10 years)
- **By Environment**: 8% accuracy reduction in urban vs. rural settings
- **By Season**: 5% variation due to daylight hours affecting activity patterns

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- **GPS Accuracy**: Limited to ~3-5 meter precision, affecting fine-grained location analysis
- **Battery Dependencies**: Behavior analysis quality degrades with low collar battery
- **Sampling Rate**: 30-second intervals may miss brief behavioral events
- **Environmental Factors**: Performance affected by extreme weather or indoor/outdoor transitions

### Behavioral Scope Limitations
- **Covered Behaviors**: Currently limited to 3 primary behaviors (sleep, pacing, fetch)
- **Missing Behaviors**: Does not detect eating, drinking, social interactions, medical episodes
- **Context Awareness**: Limited understanding of environmental context (home vs. park)
- **Individual Differences**: May not account for unique individual behavioral patterns

### Data Quality Dependencies
- **Collar Placement**: Requires proper collar positioning for accurate readings
- **Interference**: May be affected by other electronic devices or metal structures
- **Calibration**: Requires initial calibration period (7-14 days) for optimal performance
- **Data Completeness**: Performance degrades with missing or sparse data

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy and Consent
- **Data Minimization**: Only collects data necessary for behavioral analysis
- **Consent Management**: Clear opt-in process with granular privacy controls
- **Data Sharing**: No data sharing without explicit user consent
- **Geographic Privacy**: Location data anonymized to protect home addresses

### Bias and Fairness
- **Breed Bias**: Algorithm tested across diverse breed types but may have breed-specific biases
- **Size Bias**: May be less accurate for very small (<5 lbs) or very large (>100 lbs) dogs
- **Age Bias**: Performance variations noted for puppies and senior pets
- **Activity Bias**: May overrepresent active behaviors vs. sedentary ones

### Animal Welfare
- **Non-invasive Monitoring**: System designed to avoid any stress or discomfort to animals
- **Behavioral Intervention**: Alerts designed to prompt appropriate human intervention
- **Veterinary Coordination**: Integration with professional veterinary care pathways
- **Welfare Priority**: Pet welfare always prioritized over data collection

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Scenarios
- **False Medical Alerts**: Incorrectly identifying normal behavior as health concerns
- **Privacy Breach**: Unauthorized access to location or behavioral data
- **Over-reliance**: Users making medical decisions based solely on AI recommendations
- **System Failure**: Device malfunction leading to missed critical health events

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Confidence Intervals**: All outputs include uncertainty measures
- **Human Oversight**: Veterinary consultation features prominently displayed
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
- **Redundancy**: Multiple validation pathways for critical alerts

### Monitoring Plan
- **Performance Degradation**: Continuous monitoring of accuracy metrics
- **Bias Detection**: Regular auditing for demographic and behavioral biases  
- **User Feedback**: Active collection and analysis of user-reported issues
- **Expert Review**: Quarterly review by veterinary behaviorists
