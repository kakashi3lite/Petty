## Why Petty?

Pet owners want clear answers, not raw data. Petty turns collar + activity signals into plain‚Äëlanguage insights you can act on.

### What You Get

| Early wellness signals | Spot changes in routine that may warrant attention before they escalate |
| Personalized recommendations | Simple guidance (hydration, rest balance, enrichment prompts) ‚Äì no jargon |
| Secure by design | Your pet‚Äôs data is encrypted, access‚Äëcontrolled, and never sold |
| Transparent system health | Monitoring & alerts keep the service reliable so you aren‚Äôt guessing |
| Mobile + API | View on the app or integrate safely with your own tooling |
